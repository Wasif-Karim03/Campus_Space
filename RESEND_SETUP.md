# 📧 Resend Email Setup Guide

Resend is a modern email API that works perfectly with Railway and other cloud platforms. It's much more reliable than Gmail SMTP for production deployments.

---

## 🎯 Why Resend?

- ✅ **Works on Railway** - No SMTP port blocking issues
- ✅ **Free Tier** - 3,000 emails/month free
- ✅ **Fast & Reliable** - Built for developers
- ✅ **Easy Setup** - Just need an API key
- ✅ **Better Deliverability** - Emails don't go to spam

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for Resend

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (or "Get Started")
3. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
4. Verify your email address

---

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. After signing in, you'll be taken to the Resend dashboard
2. Click on **"API Keys"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"+ Create API Key"** button
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Room Booking System")
5. Select **"Sending access"** (default)
6. Click **"Add"**
7. **Copy the API key** - it starts with `re_` (you won't see it again!)
   - Example: `re_123456789abcdefghijklmnop`

⚠️ **Important**: Save this API key - you'll need it in the next step!

## Step 3: Add Domain (REQUIRED for Production)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Resend's free tier with `onboarding@resend.dev` only allows sending to your own email address. To send to other recipients (like `mwkarim@owu.edu`), you MUST verify a domain.

### Option A: Verify Your Own Domain (Recommended)

1. Go to **"Domains"** in the Resend dashboard
2. Click **"+ Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `owu.edu` or a subdomain like `mail.campusspace.com`)
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions:
   - Add the DNS records Resend provides to your domain's DNS settings
   - Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)
5. Once verified, update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` in Railway to use your domain:
   - Example: `noreply@yourdomain.com` or `noreply@mail.campusspace.com`

### Option B: Use a Subdomain (Easier)

If you don't own a domain, you can:
1. Get a free domain from services like:
   - Freenom (free domains)
   - Namecheap (cheap domains ~$1-2/year)
2. Add it to Resend and verify
3. Use it as your sender domain

**Note**: Without a verified domain, Resend will only send to the email address you signed up with!

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables to Railway

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Open your project
   - Click on your **Campus_Space** service

2. **Open Variables Tab**
   - Click on **"Variables"** tab

3. **Add RESEND_API_KEY**
   - Click **"+ New Variable"**
   - **Name**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Paste your Resend API key (from Step 2)
   - Click **"Add"**

4. **Add RESEND_FROM_EMAIL (Optional)**
   - Click **"+ New Variable"** again
   - **Name**: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
   - **Value**: Your verified email or domain email
     - If you added a domain: `noreply@yourdomain.com`
     - If using default: `onboarding@resend.dev` (for testing)
   - Click **"Add"**

---

## Step 5: Redeploy Your App

1. Railway should automatically detect the new environment variable and redeploy
2. If not, go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

---

## Step 6: Test Email Sending

1. Go to your live app: `https://campusspace-production.up.railway.app`
2. Try to sign in with email verification
3. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
4. You should receive the verification code!

---

## ✅ Verify It's Working

Check your Railway logs:

1. Go to **Campus_Space** → **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Open **"Logs"**
4. Look for: `✅ Email sent successfully via Resend to [email]`

If you see this, Resend is working! 🎉

---

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

The app is smart - it will try:
1. **Resend first** (if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set)
2. **Gmail SMTP** (if Resend fails and Gmail credentials are set)
3. **Console logging** (if neither is configured)

So your app will work even if Resend has issues!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Resend error" in logs
- Check that `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly in Railway
- Verify the API key is correct (starts with `re_`)
- Make sure you copied the entire key

### Emails not arriving
- Check spam folder
- Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is set (or using default)
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Make sure your domain is verified (if using custom domain)

### Still using Gmail SMTP
- Check logs - if you see "Gmail SMTP" it means Resend failed
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Railway
